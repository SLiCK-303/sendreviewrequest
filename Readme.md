# Send Review Request module

## About
The send review request module will send an email to the customer, who just bought an item, asking for a review.  You can set how many product links will be sent, as well as which order state to send the email at.  You can also set how long it will wait before and email is sent, via a cron job.  This module works with both the default [productcomments](https://github.com/thirtybees/productcomments), or [Datakick's revws](https://github.com/getdatakick/revws) module.

## Contributing
thirty bees modules are open-source extensions to the thirty bees e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.
