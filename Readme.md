# Send Review Request module

## About
The send review request module will send and email to the customer, who just bought an item, asking for a review.  You can set how many product links will be sent, as well as which order state to send the email at.  This module works with both the default [productcomments](https://github.com/thirtybees/productcomments), or [Datakick's revws](https://github.com/getdatakick/revws) module.

## Contributing
thirty bees modules are open-source extensions to the thirty bees e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.
