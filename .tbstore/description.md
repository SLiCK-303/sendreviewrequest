The send review request module will send and email to the customer, who just bought an item, asking for a review.  You can set how many products links will be sent, as well as which order state to send the email at.  This module works with both the default [productcomments](https://github.com/thirtybees/productcomments), or [Datakick's revws](https://github.com/getdatakick/revws) module.
